In 2004, Council member Tom Hendershot and County Executive Jack Johnson led a Charter Amendment movement (Question H) to add 2 At-Large Seats, similar to Question D. Hendershot, a former school board member, wanted to extend his tenure in a County government job, and Johnson wanted to undermine the County Council majority that had formed and was blocking his cronyism. The voters rejected Question H proposal overwhelmingly.

To enlarge the Council from nine to eleven members, adding two at-large members; providing that term limits on district members do not apply to a district member running for an at-large seat on the Council; providing that the at-large member receiving the greatest number of votes shall be Chairman of the Council.
