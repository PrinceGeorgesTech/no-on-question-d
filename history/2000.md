title:  "The 2000 Term Limit Referendum"

The term limit amendment specifically applied to terms already served, so in 1994, 7 of the 9 Council members were ineligible to run for re-election. This opened up the Council to new, fresh perspectives. Unfortunately, all but one of these new Council members got too settled in Council life and its trappings, so in 2000 they got then-State Delegate Rushern Baker to lead a movement for outright repeal of the 1992 Charter Amendment.
The Baltimore Sun captured the debate:

Term Limits on the Ballot October 30, 2000|By JoAnna Daemmrich
Prince George's and Montgomery officials pushing the issue - Political careers at stake

"Prince George's County residents have the opportunity to rescind term limits imposed in 1992. The repeal effort, launched by council members who would be forced to leave office in 2002, is being aggressively challenged by a grass-roots citizens coalition."

The New Carrollton City Council sent a letter opposing the repeal to the County Council, arguing the sentiment of many citizens:

"All sitting members [of the county council] were elected as a result of the term limits policy previously approved by the voters," the council wrote in the July 19 letter. "Any legislation that would allow that member to continue could be classed as self-serving legislation."

The County Council members, excluding Walter Maloney and Audrey Scott, ignored the Will of the People in order to advance their own interests. The voters sent a loud message to County politicians to keep their hands off of term limits in the Charter and to let the voters decide when to place the question on the ballot again.
