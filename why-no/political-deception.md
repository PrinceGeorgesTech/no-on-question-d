1. Sneak a bill on the agenda with no advanced notice.

2. Rush it immediately to 2nd reader.

3. Have a "briefing" from political insiders claiming At-large seats the reason other regional Counties are wealthier.

4. Schedule a public hearing as quickly as possible to prevent opposition from organizing.

5. Ignore the overwhelming opposition from civic leaders and County voters at the public hearing.

6. Make sanctimonious pronouncements about the "good of the County" just before voting for their self-interest.

7. Drop the At-Large Seat Charter Amendment in the middle of a series of popular Capital Bond questions and hope that voters will not recognize it.
