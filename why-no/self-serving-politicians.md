title:  Hard-working Civic Activists ~ Not Self-Serving Politicians

Prince George's County term limits were put into place by the action of average citizens. Dozens have citizens spent six months in the Spring and Summer of 1992 collecting over 15,000 signatures of registered voters to qualify [the term limit Charter Amendment](http://noonquestiond.com/AssetFiles/TermLimitMeasureMovesAhead.pdf) for the ballot. Collecting is hard, grassroots work by citizens, and the voters supported the effort.

The Charter allows citizens the right to propose an amendment to the Charter by submitting a [petition signed by 10,000 registered voters](http://noonquestiond.com/whynocitizenactionnew.html#chartersection1105). The Charter also allows at least six members of the County Council to propose any amendment, even self-serving amendments that fly in the face of citizen-driven amendments. So, after 105,000 voters went to the polls in 1992 and placed term limits in the County Charter - an effort that took dozens of activists six months to get on the ballot - in a matter of minutes, six self-serving Council members can vote to wipe out the citizen effort.

And, if the Council's proposal fails at the ballot, so be it as far as they are concerned because the Council can vote to try again and again every two years. The Council relies on its special interest friends (that want to retain reliable and pliable Council puppets) to fund their regular efforts to get around term limits, and the Council rewards these friends with special interest legislation.

The Council has continued to wield its Charter Amendment power with arrogance - Question D will mark the FOURTH time since 2000 that the voters have been asked to repeal or modify Charter Section 1105 to benefit sitting Council members.

Please do not reward the Council's continuing arrogance for County voters. Vote NO on Question D on November 8th!
