title:  "Whom Do At-large Seats Serve" 
permalink: /why-no/special-interests
---
The history of the Council is that most of the District seats have been funded over the years by special interests: developers, labor unions, County contractors and utility companies. Council Term limits have created an opportunity for grass roots candidates to be able to compete for open seats. It's tough to beat the special interest candidates, but it can happen.

HOWEVER, to win a County-wide election costs a LOT of money - hundreds of thousands of dollars. No grass roots candidate can compete.

Developers - previously the main source of campaign contributions - are now prohibited from giving directly to Council candidates. Good? Well, no. This was set up by County Senators to control who gets on the Council and what they do. Developers (and other special interests) give their contributions to Senators who can then transfer funds to Council candidates or spend money on their behalf. The "ethics reform" of 2011 was an illusion that merely created another layer putting certain political leaders in control of which candidates will be the best funded.

If we add the new At-Large Seats, the favored Council candidates will then be placed on political slates and campaign together with their political patrons. In the end, the 2 At-Large winners will be beholden to someone other than you.

### What Will Really Happen?
At-Large Council members will nominally represent every person in the County, but their interests will lie with those that got them elected. This occurs now with District-based members, as we see special zoning laws passed, sprawl development that makes no sense for the public good while Metro stations sit undeveloped, congested roads and over-crowded schools that see more development, unfunded repairs for schools and neighborhood streets, and so on.

Here is what will really happen:

- To raise $300,000 or more to run Countywide, Developers and Special Interests will fund At-Large candidates.

- At-Large candidates will rely on Senator & Executive Slates, hurting grassroots candidates.

- Winning candidates will be responsive to the demands of their funders, NOT the People that vote for them.

It will be very difficult for grassroots candidates to compete.
If Prince George's County voters approve Question D, we will get the government we deserve, and it won't be a good thing.
