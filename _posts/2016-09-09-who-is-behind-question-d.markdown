The history of the Council is that most of the District seats have been funded over the years by special interests: developers, labor unions, County contractors and utility companies. Council Term limits have created an opportunity for grass roots candidates to be able to compete for open seats. It's tough to beat the special interest candidates, but it can happen.

HOWEVER, to win a County-wide election costs a LOT of money - hundreds of thousands of dollars. No grass roots candidate can compete.

Developers - previously the main source of campaign contributions - are now prohibited from giving directly to Council candidates. Good? Well, no. This was set up by County Senators to control who gets on the Council and what they do. Developers (and other special interests) give their contributions to Senators who can then transfer funds to Council candidates or spend money on their behalf. The "ethics reform" of 2011 was an illusion that merely created another layer putting certain political leaders in control of which candidates will be the best funded.

If we add the new At-Large Seats, the favored Council candidates will then be placed on political slates and campaign together with their political patrons. In the end, the 2 At-Large winners will be beholden to someone other than you.
